Description: While gene signatures are frequently used to classify data
        (e.g. predict prognosis of cancer patients), it it not always
        clear how optimal or meaningful they are (cf David Venet,
        Jacques E. Dumont, and Vincent Detours' paper "Most Random Gene
        Expression Signatures Are Significantly Associated with Breast
        Cancer Outcome"). Based partly on suggestions in that paper,
        SigCheck accepts a data set (as an ExpressionSet) and a gene
        signature, and compares its classification performance (using
        the MLInterfaces package) against a) random gene signatures of
        the same length; b) known, (related and unrelated) gene
        signatures; and c) permuted data.
